This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Definitely a WIP

The beginning of a very simple CRA + RR + Google OAuth boilerplate. I'm just noticing that I'm building this process out too often but I want to make it more uniform so I'm still debating on how I want it to look for me, don't judge.

### Google Oauth

1. navigate to console.developers.google.com

2. Create a new Project (Make sure that you're not on a previously created project)

3. Click on the [Oauth Consent Screen](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)

4. Create Consent --> Most likely will be external for any given project --> Input Application Name --> Hit Create

5. Head over to [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)

6. +Create Credentials --> OAuth Client ID --> Choose Application Type --> follow instructions for you app time (most likely web app)

### Misc

I'm using Materialize CSS and Semantic UI CDNs because I really don't want to style it right now, I will hopefully do this down the road. Time is just not that abundant.
